Issue
=====
    An RHEL6 guest which has "eth0" as its interface is cloned using "virt-clone".The cloned machine doesn't have "eth0" anymore and it has named its interface as eth1.
    Like that if we clone a guest which has eth0 and eth1, then the cloned guests' interfaces will be named as eth2 and eth3. How can we resolve this?

    The cloned machine will display the below error message while starting network interface eth0 as per /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

    "Device eth0 does not seem to be present, delaying initializtion"

Below is /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 for the newly cloned guest which is a copy of the original machine from which a clone was created.

DEVICE="eth0"
HWADDR="52:54:00:5B:1C:AA"
NM_CONTROLLED="no"
BOOTPROTO="dhcp"
ONBOOT="yes"


Resolution
==========

Below steps can be followed the resolve this issue.

On the source machine, do the below actions.

    Edit /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net rules and remove all reference to ethx - mac address mapping from it.

    Edit /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 and remove HWADDR line from it.

    Shut down the machine and create clone out of it.

The cloned machine will now have eth0 recognized properly and /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net populated with correct eth0 -> MAC address mapping.

The other way to resolve this issue is to do the above actions on the cloned machine, but you will end up doing this task manually on all cloned machines.

The steps above (Either on the template or cloned virtual machine) can be done using "virt-sysprep" before booting the guest. This can be automated via some scripting if needed. virt-sysprep is provided by libguestfs-tools package. Refer bug 647174 for details.
Root Cause

This happens because the original machine has a udev rule like the below one in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules which maps eth0 to its mac address. The cloned machine should have a different mac address, hence the new mac address cannot be mapped to eth0. Hence it selects the next available name (eth1),

SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="52:54:00:c5:53:c7", ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="eth*", NAME="eth0"
